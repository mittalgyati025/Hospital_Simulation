# Hospital_Simulation
Developed a simulation model to investigate the effect of false alarms on clinician workload and patient safety which helps to improve alarm routing by 40%. This project implements a research paper that studies the effect of routing
policies in alarms. Mapped the read-world hospital scenarios to those discussed in paper.
